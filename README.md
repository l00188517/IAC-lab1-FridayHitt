## AWS Mini-Network Project: A DevOps and Infrastructure as Code

**Project Aim:**

To build and manage a simple AWS network infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and DevOps best practices. The project aims to:

1. **Provision AWS Resources:** Create a basic AWS network infrastructure, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, security groups, and internet gateway, using a declarative IaC tool like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
2. **Implement Infrastructure as Code:** Write IaC scripts to automate the provisioning and configuration of the AWS resources.
3. **Integrate with DevOps Pipelines:** Incorporate the IaC scripts into a CI/CD pipeline to automate the infrastructure deployment process.
4. **Explore Security Best Practices:** Implement security measures, such as network access controls and security group configurations, to protect the network.
5. **Monitor and Log:** Configure monitoring and logging tools (e.g., CloudWatch) to track the health and performance of the infrastructure.
