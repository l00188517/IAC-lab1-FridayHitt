## AWS Mini-Network Project: A DevOps and Infrastructure as Code

**Project Aim:**

To build and manage a simple AWS network infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and DevOps best practices. The project aims to:

1. **Provision AWS Resources:** Create a basic AWS network infrastructure, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, security groups, and internet gateway, using a declarative IaC tool like AWS CloudFormation.
2. **Implement Infrastructure as Code:** Write IaC scripts to automate the provisioning and configuration of the AWS resources.
3. **Integrate with DevOps Pipelines:** Incorporate the IaC scripts into a CI/CD pipeline to automate the infrastructure deployment process.
4. **Explore Security Best Practices:** Implement security measures, such as network access controls and security group configurations, to protect the network.


**How this Aligns with DevOps and Infrastructure as Code:**

* **DevOps Principles:**
    * **Automation:** Automating the infrastructure provisioning process reduces manual effort and human error.
    * **Collaboration:** Fostering collaboration between development, operations, and security teams by using a shared codebase for infrastructure.
    * **Continuous Delivery:** Integrating infrastructure changes into the CI/CD pipeline enables rapid deployment and updates.
    * **Monitoring and Logging:** Continuously monitoring the infrastructure's health and performance helps identify and resolve issues promptly.

* **Infrastructure as Code:**
    * **Declarative Configuration:** Defining the desired state of the infrastructure in code, allowing for version control and reproducibility.
    * **Idempotent Deployments:** Ensuring that infrastructure changes are applied consistently, regardless of the current state.
    * **Testing and Validation:** Implementing automated tests to validate the correctness and security of the infrastructure.
